Detectree2
==========

`Detectree2 <https://github.com/PatBall1/detectree2>`_, based on the 
`Detectron2 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2>`_ Mask R-CNN
architecture, locates trees in aerial images. It has been designed to delineate
trees in challenging dense tropical forests for a range of ecological
applications. Below is an example image of the predictions made by Detectree2.
