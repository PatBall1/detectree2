========================================
Getting Started: Your First Prediction
========================================

This tutorial goes through the essential steps of single-class (tree) detection 
and delineation from RGB data. The goal is to provide a concise, end-to-end
walkthrough to get you from an orthomosaic to a final crown prediction map.

Example data that can be used in this tutorial is available
`here <https://zenodo.org/records/8136161>`_.

The key steps are:

1. Preparing data
2. Training a model
3. Making landscape-level predictions

Before getting started ensure ``detectree2`` is installed through

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $pip install git+https://github.com/PatBall1/detectree2.git


To train a model you will need an orthomosaic (as ``<orthomosaic>.tif``) and 
corresponding tree crown polygons that are readable by Geopandas
(e.g. ``<crowns_polygon>.gpkg``, ``<crowns_polygon>.shp``). For the best
results, manual crowns should be supplied as dense clusters rather than
sparsely scattered across in the landscape. The method is designed to make 
predictions across the entirety of the supplied tiles and assumes training
tiles are comprehensively labelled. If the network is shown scenes that are 
incompletely labelled, it may replicate that in its predictions. See
below for an example of the required input crowns and image.

If you would just like to make predictions on an orthomosaic with a pre-trained
model from the ``model_garden``, skip to `Making Landscape-Level Predictions`_.

--------------
Preparing Data
--------------

First, we tile our large orthomosaic and crown data into smaller images suitable for training.

We call functions from ``detectree2``'s tiling module.

.. code-block:: python
   
   from detectree2.preprocessing.tiling import tile_data, to_traintest_folders
   import geopandas as gpd
   import rasterio

Set up the paths to the orthomosaic and corresponding manual crown data.

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Set up input paths
   site_path = "./Paracou" # Example path
   img_path = site_path + "/rgb/Paracou_RGB_2016_10cm.tif"
   crown_path = site_path + "/crowns/UpdatedCrowns8.gpkg"

   # Read in crowns and match CRS to the image
   data = rasterio.open(img_path)
   crowns = gpd.read_file(crown_path)
   crowns = crowns.to_crs(data.crs.data)

Set up the tiling parameters and tile the data. The ``tile_data`` function, when ``crowns`` is supplied, will only retain tiles that contain a certain coverage of training data.

.. code-block:: python

   # Set tiling parameters
   buffer = 30
   tile_width = 40
   tile_height = 40
   threshold = 0.6
   out_dir = site_path + "/tiles/"
   
   # Tile the data for training
   tile_data(img_path, out_dir, buffer, tile_width, tile_height, crowns, threshold, mode="rgb")

Finally, partition the tiled data into `train` and `test` sets.

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Create train/test folders
   to_traintest_folders(out_dir, out_dir, test_frac=0.15)

----------------
Training a Model
----------------

Before training can commence, it is necessary to register the training data.

.. code-block:: python
   
   from detectree2.models.train import register_train_data, MyTrainer, setup_cfg

   train_location = out_dir + "/train/"
   register_train_data(train_location, 'Paracou', val_fold=5)

Next, we configure the model. We use a ``base_model`` from Detectron2's model zoo, which provides a pre-trained backbone to speed up training.

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Set the base (pre-trained) model from the detectron2 model_zoo
   base_model = "COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_rcnn_R_101_FPN_3x.yaml"
      
   trains = ("Paracou_train",) # Registered train data
   tests = ("Paracou_val",)   # Registered validation data
   
   model_output_dir = "./train_outputs"
   
   cfg = setup_cfg(base_model, trains, tests, workers=4, eval_period=100, max_iter=3000, out_dir=model_output_dir)

Now, we can start training.

.. code-block::

   trainer = MyTrainer(cfg, patience = 5) 
   trainer.resume_or_load(resume=False)
   trainer.train()

Training outputs, including model weights, will be stored in ``model_output_dir``.

----------------------------------
Making Landscape-Level Predictions
----------------------------------

To make predictions on a full orthomosaic, we first tile it into manageable pieces.

.. code-block:: python
   
   from detectree2.models.predict import predict_on_data
   from detectree2.models.outputs import project_to_geojson, stitch_crowns, clean_crowns
   from detectron2.engine import DefaultPredictor

   # Path to the full orthomosaic
   img_path = site_path + "/rgb/Paracou_RGB_2016_10cm.tif"
   pred_tiles_path = site_path + "/tiles_pred/"

   # Specify tiling parameters (should be similar to training)
   buffer = 30
   tile_width = 40
   tile_height = 40
   tile_data(img_path, pred_tiles_path, buffer, tile_width, tile_height)

Point to your trained model, set up the configuration, and make predictions on the tiles.

.. code-block:: python
   
   # You can use your own trained model or download a pre-trained one
   # !wget https://zenodo.org/records/15863800/files/250312_flexi.pth
   
   trained_model = "./230103_randresize_full.pth"
   cfg = setup_cfg(update_model=trained_model)
   predictor = DefaultPredictor(cfg)
   predict_on_data(pred_tiles_path, predictor)

Once predictions are made on the tiles, project them back into geographic space, stitch them together, and clean up overlapping predictions.

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Project tile predictions to geo-referenced crowns
   project_to_geojson(pred_tiles_path, pred_tiles_path + "predictions/", pred_tiles_path + "predictions_geo/")

   # Stitch and clean crowns
   crowns = stitch_crowns(pred_tiles_path + "predictions_geo/")
   clean = clean_crowns(crowns, 0.6, confidence=0.5) # Filter low-confidence and overlapping crowns

----------------------------------
Saving and Visualizing Your Crowns
----------------------------------

Finally, save your cleaned-up crown map to a file.

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Simplify geometries for easier editing in GIS software
   clean = clean.set_geometry(clean.simplify(0.3))

   # Save to file
   clean.to_file(site_path + "/crowns_out.gpkg", driver="GPKG")

You can now view the ``crowns_out.gpkg`` file in QGIS or ArcGIS to see your results.
